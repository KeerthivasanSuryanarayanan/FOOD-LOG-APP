# FOOD LOG APP

The Personal Food Log App is an open-source software development project aimed to
provide users with a robust and effective manner of documenting their daily food consumption. 

## API REFERENCE

http://3.22.114.219:8000/docs - FASTAPI



TAKES THE INPUT IMAGE FROM THE USER'S DEVICE AND PREDICTS THE FOOD ITEM RECOGNIZED.


## DOCUMENTATION

Currently we have used 100 images of each of the items listed below to train the model
 1. ICE CREAM
 2. PIZZA
 3. FRIED RICE
 4. SUSHI
 5. CURRY
 6. FRENCH FRIES
 
Hence the program will be able to accurately predict all the 6 items with high confidence.
The database can be created with even more images and the prediction will become even more accurate.

## SCREENSHOTS
